 <p>My name is jaskirat kaur. I was born on 15<sup>th</sup> of  july, 2003.I am 19 years old. I passed out my high school in India  from Kamla Nehru Public School in year 2020-2022.I decided to  study in canada for my better future , so I came in Canada to  educate myself . I have taken <abbr title="Interactive Media Design ">IMD </abbr> (Interactice media design) spring  term 2023 . </p>

 <p>Talking about my hobby,I love to listen music . Music makes me calm whenever I am angry or stressed out. I love Punjabi songs,English songs as well as qwalli. My favroute singer is Babbu maan. I am so obbessed with him. His voice is everything to me. One thing that i like the most is  he write his own song as well as he compose all of his songs. </p>
